# City of Melbourne Visitor Kiosk

Group project with GEOM90007 Information Visualisation

## Design Summary

Melbourne recorded over 2 million visitors in the year ending June 2020, of which 45% travelled for a holiday and approximately 35% were first-time visitors. For tourists who are exploring the city of Melbourne for the first time, it is important to recommend places that signify Melbourne and provide meaningful information that will make the touristâ€™s stay more pleasant and memorable. Therefore, the target users of our visitor kiosk are tourists who are not familiar with the city of Melbourne. The implementation of the kiosk interface aims to provide reliable and valuable information on places to visit, eateries, transport options, public facilities and more, to make efficient informed decisions.
